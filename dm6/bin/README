This is the bin directory for the LASTZ pipeline to be functional on ANY HPC cluster


The list of the files and its description is as below:
_____________________________________________________


1) heredoc.pl

This file creates the shell scripts for the lastz and chaining stages. 
This is invoked in the first step of the pipeline. 

Read the comments for the deeper understanding of the tools used. 

INVOKED BY:runLastZchain.sh


2) runLastzChain.sh

this is the primary script that does the following

1) twoBitInfo: for the part.list creation (by another script __partitionSequence.pl__, read comments)
2) once the part.list is created, we cleanse it to create target.list and query.list
3) This sets the stage for us to invoke heredoc.pl which creates the shell scripts for each of the target and query 
4) finally, we invoke __constructLiftFile.pl__ this creates the lift files for the liftUp tool
